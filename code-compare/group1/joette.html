    <h1>Python Language explained by Joette</h1>

    <p><b>What type of language is Python?</b></p>
       <p> Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.
        </p>

    <p><b>Why use Python?</b></p>
    <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.</p>

    <p><b>What is Python mainly used for?</b></p>
    <p>Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways. SCons for build control. Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management.</p>

    <p><b>Where is Python used in real world?</b></p>
    <p>The major fields include Machine Learning and AI, Web Development, Data Analytics, Game Development, IoT, Application Development, and Game Development. Many sectors including the healthcare sector, finance sector, aerospace sector, and banking sector rely heavily on Python.</p>

    <p><b>What kind of jobs use Python?</b></p>
    <p>Python can open the gates for a sea of job opportunities, some of which are listed below.
        <ul>
       <li><i></i></li> 	Python Developer. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Software Engineer. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Data Scientist. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Quality Assurance Engineer. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Data Analyst. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Machine Learning Engineer. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Product Manager. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Educator.

      </ul>
        </p>

    <p><b>Is Python hard to learn?</b></p>
    <p>	Python is considered one of the easiest programming languages to learn. However, that doesn't mean that it's easy! While anyone can learn Python programming — even if you've never written a line of code before — you should expect that it will take time, and you should expect moments of frustration.</p>

    <p><b>What are disadvantages of Python?</b></p>
    <p>Disadvantages of Python are:

<ul>
       <li><i></i></li> 	Speed. Python is slower than C or C++. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Mobile Development. Python is not a very good language for mobile development . ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Memory Consumption. Python is not a good choice for memory intensive tasks. ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Database Access. Python has limitations with database access . ...
       <li><i></i></li> 	Runtime Errors.
    </ul>
        </p>


    <p><b>What is Python vs Java?</b></p>
    <p>The main difference between Java and Python is Java is a statically typed and compiled language which Offers limited string related functions, and Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language which offers lots of string related functions.

    </p>

    <p><b>Which one is better Java or Python?</b></p>
    <p>Python and Java are two of the most popular and robust programming languages. Java is generally faster and more efficient than Python because it is a compiled language. As an interpreted language, Python has simpler, more concise syntax than Java. It can perform the same function as Java in fewer lines of code.</p>

    <p><b>Which is easier C++ or Python?</b></p>
    <p>C++ has a lot of features and also has a comparatively difficult syntax. It is not that simple to write the C++ code. Python is easy to write and has a clear syntax. Hence writing Python programs is much easier when compared to C++.</p>

    <p><b>Where is Python not used?</b></p>
    <p>It is very rarely used for mobile development. This is the reason very few mobile applications are built in it like Carbonnelle, which is built-in python. Memory Consumption: For any memory intensive tasks Python is not a good choice. That is why it is not used for that purpose.

    <p><b>Which language is best for cyber security?</b></p>
    <p>Coding is an important skill across almost every technology discipline today, and cybersecurity is no exception. Learn about the top programming languages for security professionals.
