    <h1>What is C#?</h1>
      <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-is-C-380x380.png" />

    
    <p>C# or also known as C Sharp is a programming language developed by Anders Hjelsberg. It was initially known as ‘Cool’ which later got renamed as C Sharp. C Sharp is a high-level object-oriented program which like C++, is built over C. C# has C as its backbone. Owned by Microsoft, C# was introduced along with .NET and visual studio.</p>

<p>The C# compilers expect a  minimum and specific set of class libraries for its functioning. Class libraries that are built over the .NET framework give additional functionality. </p>

    <p><b>Features of C#</b></p>
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming: </strong>C# with its .NET framework makes it a pure object-oriented programming language. Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance make it stronger. </li>
  <li><strong>Harmony with other languages: </strong>The .NET framework allows users to use libraries of different programming languages along with C# making it easier to build, manage, and deploy the code.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple: </strong>C# is a complex but simple language to learn. It does not include complex operators.</li>
    <li><strong>Type-safe: </strong>The C# accesses memory and has access to execute the program, making it secure. Arrays are indexed zero-based and are checked rapidly. </li>

    <li><strong>Speed: </strong>The C# has many integrations inbuilt that are useful for developers to develop a code with fewer errors making the compilation and execution process faster. </li>
        <li><strong>Record Type </strong>C# comes with record types that allow users to create immutable objects which can be used instead of class and structs.</li>
            <li><strong>Top Level Statement: </strong>C#, unlike other C-based languages, has a top-level statement feature. This allows users to exclude classes, blocks, voids, etc., making shorter codes executable.  </li>
